                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50"> Technological advances in the music production industry have led to the
                  emergence of
                  advanced mobile-based software, which is used to mix and compose tracks.
                  The growing preference for live events and electronic music has led to an increase in the number of
                  DJs worldwide and a general shift to digital music within the industry.

      <!-- Users Base  -->
      <h2>User Base</h2>

      <h3>User Segmentation</h3>
      <p>Our user base is heavily segmented into subgroups that range from beginners to
        professionals. Moreover, music production does not neccessarily mean playing an instrument, but also includes
        sound engineers and producers. An initial user base segmentation focused on grouping this fragmented base into
        nine sugroups as presented below.</p>

      <div class="row align-items-center no-gutters mb-4 mb-lg-5">

          </div>

      <p>BitLabs chose to narrow down its target market to the performer subgroup early on. OrBit is designed to augment
        performance through digital elements, but could still be used in a studio setting. Performers were further
        broken down into the following:</p>

                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">Consumers may not have much music experience but have a general interest
                  in music gadgets. They usually have a limited budget for a device and use it primarily for
                  entertainment. The interaction needs to be fun for them in order to keep them interested.

                  to expand their musical possiblities. They hope the device can be a tool which improves their music
                  and helps them gain more exposure. They might tend to
                  buy a product which is more of a tool rather than a toy. More importantly, OrBit needs to give them
                  useful feedback and allow them to interact with music in a meaningful way. </p>

                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">For music professionals or performing artists precise control over their
                  performance is very important. Therefore, their requirements on functionality are higher than any
                  other user group. The device must be robust, reliable and exact.

      <h3>User Preference Analysis</h3>
      <p>The three performer subgroups were analysed individually in terms of their requirements and aspirations.
        While a consumer is looking for more of a toy and is happy with a 'gimmicky' product, a professional user needs
        exact control and as little distraction as possible. Finally, a prosumer is
        located somewhere between the two. Prosumers will aspire to own a product that can operate at a professional
        level, but accept a certain degree of imprecision within the device.</p>

            <h4>User Preference Analysis</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">BitLabs has analysed the current market and identified which product
              characteristics are most important to the performer subgroups.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>From primary (shown below) and secondary research, BitLabs has decided to focus on the prosumer market. The
        favourable ratio between spending power and desired functionality as well as the market size contributed to this
        decsision. The
        spending power of consumers would not be aligned with the hardware required for OrBit to work. Conversely,
        professional
        musicians require a level of control which would be unrealistic to achieve with a first product. Our business
        model (refer to Investor section), however, still aims to excite musicians of all levels of expertise through a
        freely available mobile demo application. In this way, BitLabs aims to speak to all branches of the heavily
        segmented music market and inspire consumers to expand their musical scope.</p>

      <h3>The Competition</h3>
      <p>
        The paradigm for controlling music software are traditional MIDI controllers. These allow musicians to control
        digital effects using physical objects such as pads, knobs or sliders. This manual form of input is not
        compatible with playing an instrument where the hands are occupied. Existing products that attempt to overcome
        this restriction include motion-sensing rings (Enhancia, Wave, HotHand). Both of them are early-stage startups.
      </p>
      <p>
        OrBit offers two key differentiators. Firstly, it has a versatile mode of attachment. Our competitors designed
        their product to only attach to a finger, essentially forcing any instrument player to couple their playing
        motions to an effect. BitLabs on the other hand gives musician freedom on where they attach the device and how
        they control effects.

        Secondly, current motion-sensing products do not offer refined tactile interactions. BitLabs has found a
        combination of the two to give more control over digital effects. OrBit will combine the freedom of motion
        control with the practicality of manual controls on the device.

      <h2>Business Development</h2>
      <h3>Strategy</h3>
      <p>BitLabs are taking a pragmatic approach to business development. We know that hardware iterations are expensive
        and that manufacturing costs present a significant barrier to entry. Releasing OrBit as a high-quality,
        innovative device for musicians remains our target, however, a strong strategy for adding
        value to the enterprise along the way is essential.</p>
      <p> For these reasons we have been developing a smartphone-based version of our product in tandem with the
        development of OrBit. This mobile app allows users to gain control of music software, enabled through the
        reading of the motion sensors embedded in all modern smartphones (iOS + Android). This product is released in
        line with a Freemium strategy in which the user is forced to upgrade to the hardware version to attain
        significant performance control. The mobile prototype is good enough to excite a user and make them want to
        perform with the technology, but will lack the attachability and physical interface of the real device. One of our major
        insights from research was that musicians want to test products before they buy them. The Freemium strategy
        allows BitLabs to reach a global user base and excite them about what OrBit could do for to their performance.
      </p>

      <h3>Route to Market</h3>
      <p>Rather than advertising OrBit as a product, we aim to get our free mobile prototype to as many musicians as
        possible. This exploits the ease of spreading digital assets and opens up the adressable market to a global
        market of musicians with a smartphone and Internet access. Of course, the challenge of making the free app known
        to potential customers remain. BitLabs is following a three-point approach to achieve that.</p>

      <p>Once an initial base of interested customers has been established, OrBit will be targeted at these users. Musicians are likely to have friends that play music and BitLabs will try to target ads to our user's social network.</p>

      <h3>Revenue Streams</h3>
      <p>BitLabs intends to capitalise on OrBit through a direct sales model. The product will be advertised on our website, through our free application, and in selected music stores. The current retail price is estimated between £100 and £200 pounds. We will sell OrBit through multiple channels, including both online stores as well as physical retail spaces.</p>
      <p>A secondary revenue stream arises from ad placement on our mobile application. This will create less value, however, is essential to support the business in its early stages.</p>
      <p>The final revenue stream are the accessories and digital presets that will be sold through BitLabs's Asset Store. This will include specific attachments mechanisms and complex filter presets for specific musicians (e.g. a reverb preset for vocalists).</p>

      <h3>IP Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        BitLabs has created IP during the development process and is aiming to protect it as part of a rigorous IP
        protection strategy. The software back-end will only be supplied to the customer in a compiled form, making it
        impossible to retrieve the original source code.
      </p>
      <p>
        With regards to physical mechanisms, BitLabs is looking at protecting its versatile and modular attachments. The
        company is currently in the process of creating an invention disclosure and will be liasing with Imperial
        Innovations to evaluate whether patent protection is feasible. Specifically, the patent would cover a wireless,
        modular, motion-sensing device with versatile attachment mechanisms for controlling digital effects.
      </p>

      <h3>The Future</h3>
      <p>
        BitLabs is designing OrBit using tried and tested tech and linking the product to existing software to keep
        development costs to a minimum. Our immediate goal is to develop the mobile prototype and platform to an extent
        where they can be distributed digitally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simulatneously, the physical prototype will be developed to a fully functional level and IP protection will be sought. Our subsequent funding campaign will be driven by the aim of miniaturising the tech, manufacturing the product, and making it available to customers through our previously established network. The upcoming milestones are summarised below.
