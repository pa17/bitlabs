                <br>
                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50"> Technological advances in the music production industry have led to the emergence of
                  advanced mobile-based software, which is used to mix and compose tracks.
                  The growing preference for live events and electronic music has led to an increase in the number of DJs worldwide and a general shift to digital music within the industry.

      <!-- Users Base  -->
      <h2>User Base</h2>

      <h3>User Segmentation</h3>
      <p>Our user base is heavily segmented into subgroups that range from beginners to
        professionals. Moreover, music production does not neccessarily mean playing an instrument, but also includes
        sound engineers and producers. An initial user base segmentation focused on grouping this fragmented base into
        nine sugroups as presented below.</p>


      <div class="row align-items-center no-gutters mb-4 mb-lg-5">
        <div class="col-xl-8 col-lg-7">

            <h4>User Base Segmentation</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Users can be categorised in terms of level of expertise and type of musician

      <p>BitLabs chose to narrow down its target market to the performer subgroup early on. OrBit is designed to augment  performance through digital elements, but could still be used in a studio setting. Performers were further broken down into the following:</p>

                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">Consumers may not have much music experience but have a general interest
                  in music gadgets. They usually have a limited budget for a device and use it primarily for entertainment. The interaction needs to be fun for them in order to keep them interested.

                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">Prosumers have more experience with music products and buy them primarily to expand their musical possiblities. They hope the device can be a tool which improves their music and helps them gain more exposure. They might tend to
                  buy a product which is more of a tool rather than a toy. More importantly, OrBit needs to give them
                  useful feedback and allow them to interact with music in a meaningful way. </p>

                  other user group. The device must be robust,  reliable and exact.

      <h3>User Preference Analysis</h3>
      <p>The three performer subgroups were analysed individually in terms of their requirements and aspirations.
        While a consumer is looking for more of a toy and is happy with a 'gimmicky' product, a professional user needs exact control and as little distraction as possible. Finally, a prosumer is
        located somewhere between the two. Prosumers will aspire to own a product that can operate at a professional level, but accept a certain degree of imprecision within the device.</p>

      </div>

      <p>From primary (shown below) and secondary research, BitLabs has decided to focus on the prosumer market. The favourable ratio between spending power and desired functionality as well as the market size contributed to this decsision. The
        spending power of consumers would not be aligned with the hardware required for OrBit to work. Conversely, professional
        musicians require a level of control which would be unrealistic to achieve with a first product. Our business
        model (refer to Investor section), however, still aims to excite musicians of all levels of expertise through a
        freely available mobile demo application. In this way, BitLabs aims to speak to all branches of the heavily
        segmented music market and inspire consumers to expand their musical scope.</p>

      <h3>The Competition</h3>
      <p>
        The paradigm for controlling music software are traditional MIDI controllers. These allow musicians to control digital effects using physical objects such as pads, knobs or sliders. This manual form of input is not compatible with playing an instrument where the hands are occupied. Existing products that attempt to overcome this restriction include motion-sensing rings (Enhancia, Wave, HotHand). Both of them are early-stage startups.

        OrBit differentiates itself from the direct competition by 

        
        
        
        
        
        
        BitLabs has compared existing products in the digital music market. OrBit aims at a
        high level of interactivity and a price at a mid range. The most direct competitors to BitLabs
        are MIDI ring controllers such as Wave and Enhancia rings. Both of them are early-stage startups.
        OrBit are unique as it has much more versatile means of attachment, which allows higher level of customisation.

      <h2>Business Development</h2>
      <h3>Strategy</h3>
      <p>BitLabs are taking a pragmatic approach to business development. We know that hardware iterations are expensive and that manufacturing costs present a significant barrier to entry. Releasing OrBit as a quality, innovative device for musicians is the goal, but we believe that a strong strategy for adding value to the enterprise along the way is important.</p>
      <p> For these reasons we have been developing a smartphone-based version of our product in tandem with the development of the OrBit device. This smartphone version allows users to use their device's web browser in order to gain control of music software, enabled through the reading of the motion sensors embedded in all modern smartphones (iOS + Android). This product is released in line with a customised Freemium strategy in which the user is forced to upgrade to the hardware version to attain significant performance control. The mobile prototype is good enough to excite a user and make them want to perform with it, but not stage-proof and of enough fidelity. One of our major insights from research was that musicians want to test products before they buy them. The Freemium strategy allows BitLabs to reach a fragmented user base and excite them about what OrBit could do for to their performance.</p>
      <h3>Channels</h3>
      <p>Rather than advertising OrBit as a product, we aim to get our free mobile prototype to as many musicians as possible. This exploits the ease of spreading digital assets and opens up the adressable market to a global market of musicians with a smartphone and Internet access. Of course, the challenge of making the free app known to potential customers remain. BitLabs is following a three-point approach to achieve that.</p>
      <li>
        Social Media: We will use targeted advertising to match viewers with musical aspiration to our adverts.
      </li> 
      <li>
        Featured Artists: BitLabs will exploit its location in London, a musical hotspot, and spotlight local and international musicians using our product. 
      </li> 
      <li>
        Community: BitLabs knows that the music scene is highly connected, which is why we aim to provide a community platform. Presets can be distributed and downloaded by users.
      </li> 
      <li>
        Excitement: Our mobile prototype can be used by people without any musical experience. By making this mobile prototype accessible to both beginners and experienced musicians, we want to share the excitement music can bring with everybody.
      </li> 
      <h3>The Future</h3>
      <p>
        BitLabs is designing OrBit with tried and tested tech and integreates it with existing software to keep development costs to a minimum. Our immediate goal is to develop the mobile prototype and platform to an extent where they can be distributed. At the same time, the physical prototype will be developed to a proof-of-concept stage. The rough timeline for next actions is shown below.
        <ol>
          <li>
          1. Deploy the free mobile prototype. Generate excitement in the user base and look for investment. 
        </li>
        <li>
          2. Look for funding and IP protection to develop the physical product for manufacture. 
        </li>
        <li>
          3. Look for funding and IP protection to develop the physical product for manufacture. 
        </li>


</ol>
<h2>Revenue Streams</h2>
<ol>
<li>Direct Sales: OrBit will generate profits through a direct sales model.</li>

<li>However, owning the product will give the user access to a wide asset store in which presets can be bought, along with further functionality.</li>
<li>
Ad revenue: Our mobile prototype will contain unobstrusive ads. Users are invited to pay a small charge to experience an ad-free experience. 
</li>
</ol>
